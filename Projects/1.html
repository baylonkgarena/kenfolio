      <strong>Accounts Payable Coordinator</strong><br><br>
      Started as an Accounts Payable Clerk and was promoted to Accounts Payable Coordinator due to demonstrated expertise in managing high-volume invoice processing. With experience leveraging SAP and Avalara, I bring a strong attention to detail, an analytical mindset, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. I excel in process optimization, compliance, and ensuring that all accounts payable functions run smoothly and efficiently. Known for my ability to communicate across departments and resolve issues quickly, I support the business in managing its financial transactions while adhering to internal controls and external regulations.
