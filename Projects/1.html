      <strong>Team Leader / Sales Agent</strong><br><br>
      As the Team Leader and Sales Agent for Converge ICTâ€™s managed service partner in Panay, I lead a remote sales team dedicated to delivering exceptional ICT solutions. With a strong focus on relationship-building and customer-centric service, I excel at connecting with clients virtually, understanding their unique needs, and providing tailored solutions that drive results. Recently, the company opened a new business center to enhance customer satisfaction, and while it serves as a local touchpoint, my expertise lies in managing remote sales efforts that ensure seamless and impactful client interactions across the region.
