      <strong>Graphic Designer</strong><br><br>
      This was my first role as a virtual assistant, where I began building skills in remote support, communication, and task management.
As a graphic designer, I gained practical experience creating evacuation diagrams, combining technical accuracy with clear visual communication. This role helped me develop a strong eye for detail and reinforced the importance of design in safety and compliance. It also prepared me for opportunities in design roles that require both creativity and precision, especially in fields where clarity and function are critical.
